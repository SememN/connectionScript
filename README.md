# Connection Script
This is a self-bot for Discord. If you want to connect to the discord channel, but it's full at the moment, you can use this script.
You just need to activate script. then input your token, and write ".connect <Voice Channel name>" to any text channel of the server, that includes <Voice Channel> to connect to.
  
  P.s. I know, that Discord forbid self-bots, but if you won't share your token with smb, everithing will be okey.
  P.s.s. I couldn't convert this .py file to .exe so you need Python and theese modules:
  
  python -m pip install discord.py
  python -m pip install asyncio
  python -m pip install PyNacl
